Discord MMO at Hack the Future
==============================

Welcome, future hacker! Discord is a Massively Multiplayer Online game,
similar to World of Warcraft or EVE Online. Of course, it looks pretty
different because it's all text, but don't worry--it's even more fun. In
Discord, YOU are the master of the world, with the power to invent objects,
create rooms, and alter the very rules that govern the world.

Setup
------

If you want to play on your own, have a mentor come over and set you up. It's
pretty quick, but the steps can get a bit tricky.

If you want to play in the world with everybody else, then jump right in! Enter
the address we give you into your web browser, and you'll be in the game. Wander
around, try things out, and get to know the world a bit. Then, come back and
start playing around with the .js files around here.

Layout
------

Most of the interesting bits are in the "world" directory, near this file you're
reading right now. They define the particular characteristics of this world,
including special commands, items, rooms, and non-playing characters (NPCs).
Your best bet is to create some new things first and try them out. That way you
won't be trying to edit the same files as anybody else, which as you can imagine
will result in a pretty broken world!
